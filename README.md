# type-equiv - Mine Equivalent Types in C

type-equiv is ongoing research and the code is rapidly changing. It is probably
not useful to many at the moment.

Requires OCaml >= 4.06.0. The current version of CIL is not compatible with
4.06.0, but you should be able to install from the [develop branch of my
fork](https://github.com/jlacomis/cil/tree/develop) using `opam pin add cil
git@github.com:jlacomis/cil.git#develop`.
